## <p align="center">ðŸ“° What is this?</p>

This repository is meant to house experimental random projects.
I used to have the habit of making a repository for every little thing I want to try which ended up in a very messy github. This way all experiments are in the same place and I can slim down my 60+ private repositories down to only a few and hopefully make the code public!
